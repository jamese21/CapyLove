# Capybara Gif Discord Bot

Whenever new commands are added the bot needs to be re-added to servers idk why

run 'node app.js' to run the bot with ngrok running

run 'ngrok http 3000' and take the https forwarding url and put it in the interactions endpoint url on the bot with '/interactions' appended to it.

run 'node run commands.js' to register new commands before readding bot to servers.

Gifs are obtained through the Giphy API.
